## <a id="question-github-repository"></a>Q: How can I configure an image to pull from a private GitHub repository?

Create a file with the following yaml replacing `[generated-token]` with a token generated using [this procedure](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
```yaml
project: project-name
repository: https://github.com
username: [generated-token]
password: 'x-oauth-basic'
```

Create the secret using the command `pb secrets git apply -f filename.yaml`

## Q: Can I use ClusterBuilder with a private builder image?

No, private images are only supported for Builder types.

## Q: My GitHub repository is public and my first build started but when I update my repo new builds are not started

If a secret was configured for GitHub make sure it was configured as described in [this question](#question-github-repository).

## Q: Why do some builds fail with `Error: failed to access run image: connect to repo store`?

If the image is configured for the same registy that the Build Service was relocated to during installation, then the
credentials configured for the image require read access to the relocated images.

## Q: Applying images with local source code fails with the error message: `ERROR: uploading source: save image: ... http2: server sent GOAWAY and closed the connection`?

Make sure to configure your ingress so that the max field size is at least 8k and the max header size is at least 32k.

If you are you using Nginx as your ingress controller then you must apply a config map to update the following settings:
```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-configuration
  namespace: ingress-nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
data:
  http2-max-field-size: "8k"
  http2-max-header-size: "32k"
```
